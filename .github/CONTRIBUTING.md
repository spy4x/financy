# Contributing to Financy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Financy! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) - Latest stable version
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For local development environment
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript, Preact, and financial concepts

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financy.git
   cd financy
   ```

2. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   deno task dev
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   deno test
   ```

## Code Style and Standards

### Formatting

- Use the project's TypeScript configuration
- Follow the patterns in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Run `deno fmt` before committing

### Key Conventions

- Files: kebab-case (`my-component.tsx`)
- Components: PascalCase (`MyComponent`)
- Functions/Variables: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_CASE
- Money: Always store as integers (cents)
- Database: All queries must be scoped per user

### Import Patterns

```typescript
import { db } from "@api/services/db.ts"
import { Component } from "@web/components/ui/component.tsx"
import { helper } from "@shared/helpers/helper.ts"
```

## Development Guidelines

### Security First

- Always validate user permissions and input
- Ensure multi-tenant data isolation
- Use database transactions for consistency
- Test role-based access control

### Financial Data Handling

- Store monetary values as integers (smallest unit)
- Preserve original currency amounts
- Handle timezone conversions properly
- Test multi-currency scenarios

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test multi-user scenarios
- Verify mobile responsiveness
