# Income Categories Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented income categories feature to distinguish between income and expense categories in the Financy application. This enables proper categorization of income vs expenses and improves budgeting logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- **Migration**: `2025_06_28_1200_category_type.sql`
  - Added `type` column to `categories` table (INT2, default 1)
  - Added enum constraint: 1=expense, 2=income
  - Added index for efficient filtering by type
  - Maintains backward compatibility (existing categories default to expense)

- **Schema Update**: Updated `libs/server/db/schema.sql` 
  - Reflects the new column and constraints in documentation

### 2. Shared Types
- **New Enum**: `CategoryType` with EXPENSE=1, INCOME=2
- **Utility Functions**: `CategoryTypeUtils` for type checking and display
- **Schema Updates**: Updated `categoryBaseSchema` to include required `type` field
- **Validation**: Added proper type validation with default to EXPENSE

### 3. Backend API
- **Commands**: Updated category commands to handle the new `type` field
- **Seed Data**: Updated preset entities handler to include both expense and income categories
- **Validation**: Ensured all category operations include proper type handling

### 4. Frontend Components

#### Category Editor (`apps/web/src/routes/categories/editor.tsx`)
- Added category type selector (Expense/Income)
- Disabled monthly budget for income categories
- Updated form validation to handle type-specific logic
- Enhanced UX with contextual help text

#### Category List (`apps/web/src/routes/categories/list.tsx`)
- Added "Type" column with colored badges (blue for expense, green for income)
- Added type filter dropdown (All Types, Expense, Income)
- Updated budget progress display (hidden for income categories)
- Enhanced filtering logic to include type filtering

#### Transaction Editor (`apps/web/src/routes/transactions/editor.tsx`)
- **Smart Category Filtering**: 
  - Credit transactions → Income categories only
  - Debit transactions → Expense categories only
- Improves UX by showing only relevant categories based on transaction type

#### Category State (`apps/web/src/state/category.ts`)
- Updated create/update functions to include `type` parameter
- Maintained existing monthly spent calculation logic (only counts expenses)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing categories default to "expense" type
- Migration preserves all existing data
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 2. **Enum Values**
- Used integers (1=expense, 2=income) following project convention
- Avoided 0 values to prevent falsy condition bugs

### 3. **User Experience**
- Intuitive visual distinction with colored badges
- Smart category filtering in transaction editor
- Disabled irrelevant fields (monthly budget for income)
- Clear filter options and labels

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- Income categories don't have monthly limits (business logic)
- Proper validation at both frontend and backend
- Consistent type checking throughout the application

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Financial Tracking**
- Clear separation between income and expense categories
- Proper categorization for financial reports
- Prevents mixing income and expense in budgets

### 2. **Improved User Experience**
- Contextual category suggestions based on transaction type
- Visual distinction between category types
- Streamlined category management

### 3. **Enhanced Budgeting Logic**
- Income categories excluded from spending limits
- More accurate budget tracking and progress
- Cleaner financial reporting

### 4. **Scalability**
- Foundation for future features (income tracking, cash flow analysis)
- Extensible type system for potential future category types
- Clean separation of concerns

## Files Modified

### Database
- `libs/server/db/migrations/2025_06_28_1200_category_type.sql` (new)
- `libs/server/db/schema.sql` (updated)
- `libs/server/db/sample-income-categories.sql` (new sample data)

### Shared Types
- `libs/shared/types/+index.ts` (added CategoryType enum and utils)

### Backend
- `apps/api/cqrs/event-handlers/seed-preset-entities-on-user-signed-up.ts` (updated)

### Frontend
- `apps/web/src/state/category.ts` (updated)
- `apps/web/src/routes/categories/editor.tsx` (enhanced)
- `apps/web/src/routes/categories/list.tsx` (enhanced)
- `apps/web/src/routes/transactions/editor.tsx` (enhanced)

## Testing

- All TypeScript compilation checks pass
- All linting and formatting checks pass
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

To complete the feature deployment:

1. **Run Migration**: Execute the database migration in your environment
2. **Test User Flows**: 
   - Create income and expense categories
   - Create transactions and verify appropriate category filtering
   - Test budget progress display for both types
3. **Optional**: Run the sample data script to populate test categories

The implementation follows Financy's coding conventions and maintains the high-quality standards established in the codebase.
