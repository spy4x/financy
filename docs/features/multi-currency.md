## Architecture Overview

### Database Schema

#### Exchange Rates Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE exchange_rates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    from_currency_id INT4 NOT NULL REFERENCES currencies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    to_currency_id INT4 NOT NULL REFERENCES currencies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rate NUMERIC(18, 8) NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    fetched_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    CONSTRAINT unique_rate_per_day UNIQUE (from_currency_id, to_currency_id, date)
);
```

**Key Points:**
- High-precision rates with NUMERIC(18, 8)
- Daily rate storage with unique constraint
- Tracks when rates were fetched vs created
- Supports soft deletion

#### Transaction Enhancements

Transactions already support multi-currency via:
- `original_currency_id` - Original transaction currency (NULL if same as account currency)
- `original_amount` - Original amount before conversion
- `amount` - Converted amount in account currency

#### Group Base Currency

Groups have `currency_id` as the base currency for reporting and conversions.

### Backend Architecture

#### Pure Currency Helpers (`libs/shared/helpers/currency.ts`)

Core conversion logic using pure functions:

```typescript
// Pure functions that accept exchange rates as parameters
getExchangeRate(rates: ExchangeRate[], from: number, to: number, date?: Date): number | null
convertAmount(amount: number, fromCurrencyId: number, toCurrencyId: number, rates: ExchangeRate[]): number | null
```

**Benefits:**
- No database dependencies
- Easy to test
- Reusable across frontend and backend
- Supports USD-based cross-currency conversion

#### Exchange Rate Provider (`apps/api/services/exchange-rate-provider.ts`)

Simplified rate fetching and storage:

```typescript
class ExchangeRateProvider {
  async fetchAndStoreRates(): Promise<void>
  async getRate(fromCurrencyId: number, toCurrencyId: number, date?: Date): Promise<number | null>
}
```

**Features:**
- Uses exchangerate-api.com (free tier: 1,500 requests/month)
- USD-based conversion strategy
- Error handling with retry logic
- Caches rates in Valkey (Redis)
- Stores historical rates in database

#### Background Workers

**Exchange Rate Fetcher** (`apps/api/workers/exchange-rate-fetcher.ts`):
- Runs daily to fetch updated exchange rates
- Supports all currencies in the database
- Error handling and logging
- Integrates with global sync system

### Frontend Architecture

#### State Management

**Currency State** (`apps/web/src/state/currency.ts`):
```typescript
export const currency = {
  list: Signal<Currency[]>,
  fiatCurrencies: Computed<Currency[]>,
  cryptoCurrencies: Computed<Currency[]>,
  getById(currencyId: number): Currency,
  getByCode(code: string): Currency,
}
```

**Exchange Rate State** (`apps/web/src/state/exchange-rate.ts`):
```typescript
export const exchangeRate = {
  list: Signal<ExchangeRate[]>,
  getAll(): ExchangeRate[],
}
```

Both integrate with WebSocket for real-time updates.

#### UI Components

**MultiCurrencyAmountInput** (`apps/web/src/components/ui/MultiCurrencyAmountInput.tsx`):
- Combined amount input with currency selector
- Real-time conversion preview
- Shows exchange rates used
- Supports both account and transaction currencies

**MultiCurrencyAccountBalance** (`apps/web/src/components/ui/MultiCurrencyAccountBalance.tsx`):
- Display account balance in native currency
- Show converted value in group base currency
- Summary component for total balance across accounts
- Percentage breakdown by currency

**TransferForm** (`apps/web/src/components/TransferForm.tsx`):
- Specialized form for cross-currency transfers
- Account selection with currency display
- Exchange rate display with manual override
- Real-time conversion preview

**MultiCurrencyDashboard** (`apps/web/src/components/MultiCurrencyDashboard.tsx`):
- Total balance across all currencies
- Currency diversity metrics
- Currency breakdown with percentages
- Recent cross-currency transactions

## Implementation Details

### Currency Conversion Flow

1. **Transaction Creation:**
   - User selects transaction currency (defaults to account currency)
   - If different from account currency, original amount is stored
   - Backend converts using latest exchange rate
   - Both original and converted amounts are saved

2. **Cross-Currency Transfer:**
   - User selects source and target accounts
   - System fetches exchange rate between currencies
   - Shows conversion preview with rate
   - Creates two linked transactions with proper amounts

3. **Balance Display:**
   - Account balance calculated in account's native currency
   - Converted to group base currency for display
   - Total balance aggregates across all accounts
   - Shows currency breakdown

### Exchange Rate Strategy

**USD as Base Currency:**
All exchange rates are stored relative to USD, enabling efficient conversions:

```
EUR -> JPY conversion:
1. Get EUR/USD rate
2. Get JPY/USD rate  
3. Calculate: amount * (EUR/USD) / (JPY/USD)
```

This approach:
- Reduces database storage (N currencies need N-1 rate pairs, not N*(N-1))
- Simplifies rate fetching from external APIs
- Maintains accuracy through direct API rates

### Data Integrity

- **Original amounts preserved:** Never lose the original transaction currency/amount
- **Audit trail:** `fetched_at` tracks when rates were updated
- **Validation:** Exchange rates validated before storage
- **Fallback:** Last known rate used if new fetch fails

## Current Known Issues

### Fixed Issues

‚úÖ **Transaction List Import Error** - Missing import for `currency` and `account` modules
- **Impact:** Currency filter in transaction list causes "currency is not defined" error
- **Status:** Fixed

{
  "result": "success",
  "base_code": "USD",
  "conversion_rates": {
    "EUR": 0.92,
    "GBP": 0.79,
    "JPY": 149.50,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Future Considerations

**Backup Provider: fixer.io**
- 100 requests/month free
- 170+ currencies
- Historical data support

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Cache rates in Valkey for 1 hour
- Store historical rates in database
- Fetch once daily (background worker)
- Manual refresh option for admins

## Security Considerations

1. **Validation:** All currency inputs validated against database
2. **Rate Limits:** API key usage monitored
3. **Audit Trail:** All conversions logged
4. **Fallback:** Manual rate entry for emergency situations

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching:** Exchange rates cached in Valkey (1 hour TTL)
2. **Database Indexes:** Optimized for currency lookups
3. **Batch Processing:** Bulk conversions processed efficiently
4. **Rate Limiting:** External API calls throttled

## Migration & Backward Compatibility

### Data Migration

Existing data remains unchanged:
- Single-currency accounts continue to work
- No disruption to existing transactions
- Gradual adoption of multi-currency features

### Migration SQL

```sql
-- Populate missing currency data for existing accounts
UPDATE accounts SET currency_id = (
  SELECT currency_id FROM groups WHERE groups.id = accounts.group_id
) WHERE currency_id IS NULL;
```
