# Scaling and Deployment

## 1. **Containerized Infrastructure**

- **Docker Compose**:
  - All services (frontend, backend, database, valkey, traefik, etc.) are
    containerized for local development and deployment.
- **Production**:
  - Horizontal scaling:
    - Scale backend API by spinning up multiple instances behind a reverse proxy
      (e.g., Traefik).
    - Valkey used for caching and WebSocket horizontal scaling.
  - Future migration to Docker Swarm or K8s for multi-machine clusters as the
    app grows.

## 2. **Load Balancing and Caching**

- **Traefik**:
  - Reverse proxy and load balancer managing traffic flow between containers.
  - HTTPS handled with Let's Encrypt for self-signed certificates (ideal for
    self-hosted environments).
- **Valkey Caching & Pub/Sub**:
  - Optimizes database queries with heavy caching for static/shared data.
  - Prepares WebSocket scaling (if added in the future).
