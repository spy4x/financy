# Features Overview

## 1. **Core Financial Management**

- **Income and Expense Tracking**:
  - Record income and expenses with support for categories and tags for better
    organization.
- **Accounts across Groups**:
  - Accounts can belong to one or multiple groups, each group representing
    contexts such as Family, Business, Trips, etc.
  - By default, account transactions are visible to all groups they belong to,
    allowing calculations like balances to be group-scoped but still
    interconnected where needed.
  - Notifies users when transactions are added to shared accounts.
- **Categories and Tags**:
  - Group transactions with predefined categories and user-assigned tags for
    granular reporting.
- **Multi-Currency Tracking**:
  - Facilitate financial management in different currencies:
    - Keep transactions' original amounts (`original_amount` in vendor
      currency).
    - Display currency-converted totals in account-level and group-level default
      currencies.
    - Fetch live exchange rates periodically from a third-party provider.
- **Debt Management**:
  - Track debts, both owed by the user and loaned to others, with clear
    indicators of outstanding balances.

## 2. **Group Collaboration and Sharing**

- Users can create **Groups** (e.g., Personal, Family, Travel Friends, Business)
  to manage finances cooperatively.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with roles:
  - **Viewer**: Can view group transactions and account balances.
  - **Editor**: Can add or edit transactions within the group.
  - **Admin**: Can manage group members, including adding/removing users.
  - **Owner**: Full control over everything; ownership can be transferred to
    another user (must stay as admin if transferred).

## 3. **API & Telegram Bot Integration**

- Public API with tokenized access to support integrations with other automation
  tools like Zapier or bespoke scripts.
- Add transactions quickly via Telegram using natural language input:
  - Example: "Add $25 for McDonald's" automatically tags the transaction as
    food.
  - Supports time-based entries (e.g., "50 USD at 7 PM yesterday").
- **Error Feedback**:
  - If the parsing fails (e.g., due to missing categories or accounts), it saves
    to a default category, notifies the user about missing details, and allows
    manual corrections.
- Same permission and group logic applies to the bot as it does in the web app.

## 4. **Statistics and Reporting**

- **Group and Account Analysis**:
  - Monthly/yearly cash flow reports for groups and accounts.
  - Group-specific overviews to track expenses and incomes with aggregated
    balances.
- **Detailed Insights**:
  - Reports highlighting spending trends by category/tag. Allows comparison
    across timeframes (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
- **Visual Charts**:
  - Pie charts for categories/tags distribution and bar graphs for income vs.
    expenses.

## 5. **Transparency and Auditing**

- Track **transaction authorship** with a `user_id` field for every recorded
  transaction.
- Audit Trails:
  - Maintain logs of edits for clarity in shared groups (e.g., who made changes
    to a particular transaction).
- Sync Logs:
  - Ensure transparency in syncing transactions by marking unsynced entities
    with indicators and clearing them once synced.

---

## 6. **Backup and Restoration**

- Provide tools for users to backup their data into a user-friendly format like
  JSON/SQL dump file.
- Restoration:
  - Backup files create new accounts/groups to avoid overwriting current live
    data.

---

## 7. **Futureproofing for Expansion**

- **Planned Extensions**:
  - Split expenses functionality for group expenses (e.g., "Split $250 + $25 tip
    between Users A and B").
  - Support for crypto assets and stock investments in group and individual
    accounts.

    entry for users.
  - Expandable sections to reveal advanced features for power users.
  - Mobile-first PWA (Progressive Web App) design for responsive usability on
    all devices.

  - Each user operates within isolated datasets for personal and business use
    cases.
