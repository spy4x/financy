# High-Level Architecture

- **Web Application**:
  - Built as a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** for offline caching,
    responsiveness, and cross-platform usability.
  - **Mobile-first design** with a responsive layout tailored for small screens
    but fully functional on desktops.
  - Future plan to use tools like **Capacitor** to wrap the app for native app
    stores (Android/iOS).

- **Backend and API**:
  - **Deno** platform for modern server-side implementation, leveraging the
    ecosystem's inherent improvements (e.g., TypeScript-first, secure defaults).
  - **Hono.js** used for lightweight, fast REST API and WebSocket API support
    for live notifications.
  - **REST API** endpoints:
    - Simple, RESTful architecture for the core CRUD operations (e.g.,
      transactions, groups, accounts).
    - Sync endpoints for pushing updates to the server (batch operations
      supported).

- **Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL** as the core database for strong relational data handling and
    complex queries.
  - All monetary values stored as integers in their smallest currency unit
    (e.g., cents, satoshis) to avoid floating-point rounding errors.
  - Designed to handle multi-currency transactions with original and converted
    amounts stored explicitly.
  - Enum-like values (e.g., transaction types, sync statuses) stored as `INT2`
    with mappings in the app for extensibility.
  - Considered **TimescaleDB** for future needs of financial forecasting and
    time-series data but sticking with plain PostgreSQL initially.

- **Sync Mechanism**:
  - Offline-first optionality reduced in scope for simplicity. Users can only
    **add transactions offline**, which are queued for server sync upon
    reconnection.
  - **REST-based synchronization**:
    - Pull updated and deleted entities via `GET /updates`.
    - Push pending changes via `PATCH /updates` (batch changes supported).

- **Bot Integration**:
  - Telegram bot containerized separately for modularity and scalability:
    - Parses human-friendly text (e.g., "Add $70 for dinner").
    - Errors fallback to presets (e.g., default group or category) and notify
      users to fill missing data.
    - Lightweight self-hostable **LLM (like OpenAI's GPT models)** ensures local
      AI-driven parsing.
  - Bot adheres to the same RBAC rules and permissions as the main app.

## User Privacy and Data Security

- **HTTPS Everywhere**:
  - All API and bot endpoints will enforce encrypted HTTPS traffic.

- **Auditing and Transparency**:
  - Every transaction is attributed to the user who created it via a
    `created_by` identifier.
  - Audit trails available for group-level changes (e.g., who edited or added a
    particular transaction).

- **Backup and Restore**:
  - Users can create full backups (e.g., `.sql` files) at any point.
  - Restoration creates new accounts/groups to avoid unintended overwrites.
