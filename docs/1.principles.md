# Core Principles and Values

## 1. **Transparency**

- Financial management apps build trust when they provide clear, consistent
  views of finances. Financy ensures:
  - Permissions are clearly defined in groups, with robust role-based access to
    sensitive information.
  - Logging every transaction and change for clear accountability among group
    members.
  - Consistent and trustworthy sync operations ensure user confidence in the
    accuracy of reported data.

## 2. **Scalability and Extensibility**

- Financy is built to grow incrementally while remaining lightweight and
  modular.
- Extensibility baked into design:
  - New features (like asset management or recurring transactions) can evolve
    from the core financial model.
  - Roles and permissions can grow beyond the Viewer/Editor/Admin model if
    needed.
  - Future external integrations (Zapier, Telegram Bots, etc.) can use a
    clearly-defined and documented API.

## 3. **Accessibility**

- **For Everyone**:
  - Grandparents and tech-savvy users alike should be able to use the app.
    Usability aids include:
    - Preset defaults for most fields to ensure a quick and frictionless
      financial entry.
    - A simple flow for adding transactions, visible even on mobile devices
      without access to the full desktop UI.
    - Focused defaults over complexity: Most users should only need the **amount
      field** (currency, timestamp, etc., prefilled).
  - Advanced users can unlock layers of functionality with expandable
    features/tabs.
- Offline transaction adding is supported for situations without connectivity,
  with data synced to the server once online.

---

## 4. **Security**

- HTTPS enforced and abstraction of sensitive data (e.g., hashed passwords).
- Role-based logic means only authorized users can access shared group data.
- Audit trails for transparency in group edits, changes, or additions.

---

## 5. **Data Ownership**

- Users own their data:
  - Full backups are possible at any stage, giving them complete control.
  - Open database schema ensures no vendor lock-in for data migration/exporting.

---

## 6. **Iterative Simplicity**

- Features will be rolled out incrementally:
  - MVP focuses on single-user groups, basic transaction management, and
    simplified bots.
  - Group transparency, advanced A.I. parsing, and Asset/crypto tracking come in
    future releases to avoid overengineering the first release.
