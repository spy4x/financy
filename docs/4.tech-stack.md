# Tech Stack Details

## 1. **Frontend**

- **Svelte**:
  - Chosen for its lightweight nature, simplicity, and ability to create highly
    interactive UIs without bloated dependencies.
  - Focused on PWA principles for mobile-first use while supporting desktop-wide
    layouts.

- **Frontend Database**:
  - Local database (IndexedDB or WASM-Powered Postgres like `pglite`) to
    temporarily store offline transactions for syncing.
  - Transactions added offline are flagged for later syncing, but no full
    offline functionality (like calculations/statistics) is supported.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Uses **TailwindCSS** for styling with predefined themes and responsive
    design breakpoints.
  - Expandable UI sections for advanced features (e.g., audit trails,
    multi-currency views), keeping the interface friendly for non-technical and
    power users alike.

## 2. **API Backend**

- **Deno**:
  - Modern platform chosen for strong TypeScript integration, faster execution,
    and improved security (e.g., sandboxed runtime).
  - Ideal for modular, reusable builds that can be scaled horizontally in a
    containerized infrastructure.

- **Hono.js**:
  - A fast, minimalistic web framework that supports REST and WebSocket APIs.
  - Useful for building lightweight services without unnecessary complexity.

- **Valkey (KV)**:
  - Used for:
    - Aggressive caching of frequently fetched data such as exchange rates or
      user group memberships.
    - Managing WebSocket state for notifications (optional for future).
  - Helps scale the API horizontally if needed.

- **Multi-Tenant Design**:
  - All tables and backend logic are scoped per user:
    - Completely isolated datasets per user, whether personal or business.
    - Users can invite group members via email, and permissions are dynamically
      mapped by group association.

## 3. **Database**

- **PostgreSQL Database**:
  - Centralized relational database, optimized for financial data integrity and
    complex queries like yearly comparisons or group cash flow monitoring.
  - **Normalization**:
    - Detailed normalization ensures relational consistency (e.g., accounts
      belonging to one or more groups).
    - Separate tables store auxiliary mappings (e.g., category names, tags).
  - **Scalable Query Design**:
    - Use of `INDEX` on `updated_at` for fast sync comparisons.
    - Future partitioning options for high-query frequency tables (e.g.,
      transactions can be partitioned by group ID or time period for fast
      reads).

- **Monetary Value Storage**:
  - Stored as **integers** (in smallest unit, e.g., cents for USD) for
    precision.
  - Conversion values for multi-currency transactions stored with original
    values + exchange rate history.

## 4. **Telegram Bot**

- **Natural Language Parsing**:
  - AI-driven system parses human language into structured data (`amount`,
    `category`, `timestamp`, etc.).
  - Lightweight LLM model embedded in its own service container using
    open-source models for self-hosting.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If user input is incomplete or invalid, transactions are saved with
    defaults, and the user is notified with prompts for further details.
  - Resilience to ambiguous instructions:
    - If a request references non-existent entities (e.g., categories or
      groups), defaults will be applied or inferred contextually.

- **Bot Permissions**:
  - Fully aligned with the web app's RBAC system:
    - Bot can only see and interact with the same entities (groups, accounts,
      etc.) as the user.
