## Documentation

- [**Project Overview**](docs/1.principles.md) - Core principles and vision
- [**Features**](docs/2.features.md) - Detailed functionality and capabilities
- [**Architecture**](docs/3.architecture.md) - System components and interactions
- [**Technology Stack**](docs/4.tech-stack.md) - Tools and frameworks used
- [**Deployment**](docs/5.deployment.md) - Installation and setup instructions
- [**Infrastructure**](docs/6.infrastructure.md) - Deployment and hosting information

## Quick Start

Prerequisites (unix-like OS):

- [Deno](https://deno.land/): `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh`
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh`

To start local development:

1. Clone the repository
2. **Install git hooks** (important for code quality):
   ```sh
   deno task hooks:install
   ```
3. Start all services:
   ```sh
   deno task compose up -d
   ```

## Seed Data

For development and testing purposes, you can populate the database with comprehensive test data:

```sh
deno task db:seed
```

This command wipes all existing data (except migrations) and recreates seed data including:

- Test user account (`test@test.com` / `pass1234`)
- Sample groups, accounts, categories, and transactions
- Historical exchange rates and multi-currency data
- Complete authentication setup for testing

## Development Commands

For development and code quality, use these commands:

- **`deno task check`** - Run comprehensive checks (TypeScript, linting, formatting, tests)
- **`deno task fix`** - Automatically fix linting and formatting issues
- **`deno task test`** - Run test suite only
- **`deno task ts:check`** - TypeScript check only

This will launch all necessary services & apps in Docker Compose.
