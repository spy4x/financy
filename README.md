## Quick Start

Prerequisites (unix-like OS):

- [Deno](https://deno.land/): `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh`
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh`

To start local development:

1. Clone the repository
2. **Install git hooks** (important for code quality):
   ```sh
   deno task hooks:install
   ```
3. Start all services:
   ```sh
   deno task compose up -d
   ```

## Development Commands

For development and code quality, use these commands:

- **`deno task check`** - Run comprehensive checks (TypeScript, linting, formatting, tests)
- **`deno task fix`** - Automatically fix linting and formatting issues
- **`deno task test`** - Run test suite only
- **`deno task ts:check`** - TypeScript check only

This will launch all necessary services & apps in Docker Compose.
